Title: Love letter to Dad.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good morning dad, Happy Father's Day.

I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for bringing me to life along
with mom and the love you have given me. Thanks for everything you have taught
me through the journey and giving me the best education a son can get. 

I have tried to live the best life I possibly could. You taught me how to fend
for myself and to prepare for the journey ahead. It has given me the skills and
the strength to keep going when I have been far away from home, family and the
friends with whom I grew up.

Needless to say, it has been hard. There have been many challenges, bumps and
obstacles along the road. I have made many mistakes, and will continue to do so.
I've fallen many times, and some of those have hurt so much. But, I have kept
going just like you would. I wish I could have at least a tenth of the
resilience, strength and the optimistic outlook you have in life. 

I have not been alone in this journey. Along the way, I have met and been
surrounded by kind, generous, loving people who have helped me so much without
asking for anything in return when all I could offer was my friendship. They have
made the journey amazing, much more than we could have ever imagined, and there
is so much more to come ahead. I can only hope that you get to meet them one
day. I also realize it is not feasible, given that there are so many friends,
and so little time. In the mean time, all I can do is tell you through my
stories how wonderful these fellow human beings are.

Thanks for teaching me the love for humankind's knowledge. Please know that
every day I am doing everything I can to pass on that knowledge to generations
to come. That is what I have been doing all along and continue to do. I feel
thankful for that.

Thanks,
  son.
