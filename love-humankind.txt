A message of love to humankind
Date: 2021-06-23


How do we preserve humankind?

We may not realize it, maybe not even in our own lifetime. We, both you and I, are all blessed. It is because we are all in this, saving humankind, together. We are all connected to our ancestors, to our future generations and to one another through the interactions of our life times. But it is even simpler than that, both you and I have something in common, we are both human.

It makes sense to love one another. All it takes is to share your love with the ones around you, make someone else's life better with small acts of kindness at a time. And simply trust that it will have an impact on saving us all beyond our lifetime. We are all connected, remember.

If you think this message will make a difference in someone's life, please share it. For me, my small act of kindness now is sharing this with you.

Why now? well, why wait any longer?
